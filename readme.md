A summary section. As a lover of craft beer and of the variety of styles that can be found around the United States, I wanted to create a web app that allows others to find local breweries in their city. Users can search for any number of breweries in their city (up to 50 at a time) and learn where the brewery is located.

This web app uses: HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery

To access the Yelp API I had to use a proxy server to allow client (CORS) requests.
